# Expense Tracker (C++ + SQLite)
A simple CLI-based expense tracker built in C++ that uses SQLite for persistent data storage.

## Features
- Add, view, filter, update, and delete expenses
- Uses object-oriented programming (encapsulation, inheritance)
- SQLite integration for real database handling

## Motivation
Part of my summer coding practice to stay consistent and enhance my resume with real, functional C++ projects.
